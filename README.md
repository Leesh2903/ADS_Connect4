# ADS_Connect4


Hi, this file will explain how to successfully compile and run my ADS Connect 4 program!


You will need a version of Visual Studio , the version I am using is VS 2019. This will give you access to the developer command prompt
where you will be able to compile and run the program. 

Once you have your developer command prompt open follow these steps to compile and run.

Step 1: 

Find the Directory where the Program can be located, you can navigate to this using cd "directory name". 
Eg.  cd "Algorithms and Data Structures"


Step 2: 

Once you are successfully within the correct directory you can compile your program with the command - cl ADS_Connect4.c 
This should compile the program successfully allowing it to be run on your terminal.

If you are having issues you may need to check make sure you have the correct Build Tools installed on your version of Visual Studio, this is relatively 
easy to solve. It can be found under the Tools drop down menu within VS and will navigate you to a menu where you can install the necessary tools.


Step 3:

Now you have your compiled program you can now run it. To do this you must enter into the terminal -  ADS_Connect4
This should successfully run the program and allow you to play it.


Step 4:

Have fun!
